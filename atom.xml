If you are interested in the full series, please click the mentioned page.</p><h1 id="Netbus"><a href="#Netbus" class="headerlink" title="Netbus"></a>Netbus</h1><p>NetBus is a remote access tool (RAT) to control Microsoft Windows systems. It was created in 1998 and became controversial due to its potential use as a Trojan horse.</p><p>NetBus was written in Delphi by Carl-Fredrik Neikter. It was in wide circulation before <strong>Back Orifice</strong> was released.</p><p>In modern RAT architecture, the system typically consists of two components: a client and a server. In many contemporary C2 frameworks——such as <strong>Cobalt Strike</strong>, <strong>Armitage</strong> or <strong>United Rake</strong>——the architecture may involve multiple clients connecting to a C2 server. However, in the late 1990s, the “client” refers to the attacker-side controller application, while the “server” refers to the payload installed on the victim machine.</p><p>In this article, the following versions are analyzed:</p><ul><li>NetBus 1.20</li><li>NetBus 1.53</li><li>NetBus 1.60</li><li>NetBus 1.70</li><li>NetBus 2.0 Pro</li><li>NetBus 2.1 Pro</li></ul><h1 id="Experimental-Environment-Setup"><a href="#Experimental-Environment-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Environment Setup"></a>Experimental Environment Setup</h1><p>To safely conduct malware analysis, the environment should be isolated using virtual machines.

This explains why a GUI application developed decades ago can still execute on modern Windows 10 systems. This behavior is expected. However, some features may no longer function correctly due to changes in Windows system architecture and security configuration over time. The officially supported operating systems at the time included:</p><ul><li>Windows 95</li><li>Windows 98</li><li>Windows ME</li><li>Windows NT 4.0</li></ul><p>Now let’s take a look at the user interface. In version 1.20, only basic features are available. Some functions no longer operate correctly on modern systems. Overal, this version contains simple features. It does not involve modern features, such as file manager (but version 1.70 does).</p><p>Next, execute <code>SysEdit.exe</code> on Windows XP machine, When executed on a Windows XP system, <code>SysEdit.exe</code> binds to TCP ports 12345 and 12346 to listen for incoming connections. These port numbers appear to be hardcoded and cannot be modified through the interface in this version.<br><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs plaintext">&gt; netstat ano | find &quot;12345&quot;<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>No firewall warning dialog is triggered on a Windows XP x64 system.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/5.png'><img src="/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/5.png" width=1000></p><h2 id="Analyze-the-Protocol"><a href="#Analyze-the-Protocol" class="headerlink" title="Analyze the Protocol"></a>Analyze the Protocol</h2><p>Wireshark filter:<br><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs plaintext">ip.src == 10.98.217.130 || ip.dst == 10.98.217.130<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>After connecting to the server (<code>SysEdit.exe</code>):</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/6.png'><img src="/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/6.png" width=700></p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/9.png'><img src="/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/9.png" width=700></p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/10.png'><img src="/images/article/2026-2-18-NetBus/10.png" width=700></p><p>After TCP handshake, the server notifies the client using a plain text <code>Netbus\r</code>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h1><p>Recently, I have been developing different types of remote access tools (RATs).<br>My interest in RAT development originates from personal curiosity and long-term fascination with how remote control malware works internally.</p><p>Years ago, when I was a begineer in cybersecurity——and by “begineer,” I truly mean knowing almost nothing beyond simple denial-of-service attempts using the <code>ping</code> command in <code>cmd.exe</code>——I used to download numerous tools from various websites. At that time, I barely understood operational security or the risks involved. However, experimenting with existing tools was, in my case, the only accessible way to explore cybersecurity as a middle school student.</p><p>Over the years, my perspective has changed. Instead of merely using tools, I become more interested in understanding how they are designed and implemented. Today, I have published several remote access tools for educational and research purposes, such as <a href="https://github.com/iss4cf0ng/DuplexSpyCS">DuplexSpy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iss4cf0ng/Eden-RAT">Eden-RAT</a>. Other projects are still under development or being rewritten. </p><p>Some may ask: why develop multiple RATs? What are the differences? Looking back at 2016, when The Shadow Brokers leaked numerous tools allegedly associated with the National Security Agency <sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>, one important lesson become clear: advanced threat groups often develop multiple implants and remote access tools tailored for different operational stages and objectives.</p><p>During my own development process, I began recalling the older RATs I had downloaded but never truly understood. Recently, as I have been studying reverse engineering and malware analysis more systemically, I realized this presents and excellent opportunity to revist those historical tools——not to use them, but to analyze and understand their architecture.</p><p>Cybersecurity has gradually become more complex. The number of domains, tools, and technologies continues to grow, while learning resources can feel fragmented. The gap between begineers and experienced professional seems wider than ever. This is one of the reasons I started publishing technical articles on my blog. While blogging may feel somewhat old-school, I prefer structed and long-form documentation of knowlege.</p><p>In this series, I will analyze different generations of remote access tools——from early legacy trojans to more modern modular RATs——focusing on architecture, communication protocols, and design evolution from a reverse engineering perspective.</p><h1 id="Articles"><a href="#Articles" class="headerlink" title="Articles"></a>Articles</h1><p>The table below lists all articles in this series analyzing various remote access tools.<br>It will be updated continuously as new research is published.</p><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th>RAT</th><th>Article</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NetBus</td><td><a href="https://iss4cf0ng.github.io/2026/02/18/2026-2-18-Netbus/">Analyzing NetBus</a></td></tr><tr><td>Back Orifice</td><td>Coming soon…</td></tr><tr><td>SubSeven</td><td>Coming soon…</td></tr><tr><td>Beast</td><td>Coming soon…</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h1 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h1><blockquote id="fn_1"><sup>1</sup>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers</a><a href="#reffn_1" title="Jump back to footnote [1] in the text."> &#8617;</a></blockquote>]]></content>

I then recalled one of my earlier projects that had been suspended due to my limited development experience at the time. Therefore, I decided to revisit and complete it.</p><p>The idea of this project originated when I was learning web penetration testing.<br>When discovering an RCE (Remote Code/Command Execution) vulnerability, we usually demonstrate it with simple Linux commands(e.g., <code>id</code>, <code>whoami</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>cat /etc/passwd</code>), and that is often the end of the story. However, if we want to conduct further post-exploitation——such as pivoting into the internal network——we may rely on reverse shell tools like <code>metasploit</code>, <code>nc</code> or <code>openssl</code>. Although they are powerful and widely used, they still have certain limitations in practical penetration testing scenario.s<br>Therefore, I decided to develop a GUI-based remote access tool which can be leveraged after achieving RCE, establishing a robust and secure channel with an interactive shell and file manager.</p><p>Developing and maintaining this tool entirely on my own is challenging due to limited time, resources, and experience. As a result, the project may still contain undiscovered defects or design flaws. If you encounter any issues while using this tool, please feel free to open an issue or contact me.</p><p>If you find this tool informative or helpful, a star ⭐ will be greatly appreciated. </p><p>If you are interested in a demonstration of exploitation, please <a href="https://iss4cf0ng.github.io/2026/02/09/2026-2-9-EdenPentestInitialStage/">click here</a>.</p><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Eden-RAT is a lightweight Remote Access Tool (RAT) designed for the initial stage of penetration testing.<br>It provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with multiple features targeting Linux systems, including a file manager and an interactive shell.</p><p>The interactive shell enables full command execution, allowing users to run commands such as <code>ssh</code>, <code>apt</code>, <code>pip install</code>, <code>vim</code>, and other interactive programs seamlessly.</p><p>Github Repository: <a href="https://github.com/iss4cf0ng/Eden-RAT/">https://github.com/iss4cf0ng/Eden-RAT/</a></p><h1 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h1><h1 id="Features-1"><a href="#Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h1><h2 id="Eden-Operator"><a href="#Eden-Operator" class="headerlink" title="Eden (Operator)"></a>Eden (Operator)</h2><ul><li>Build Payload</li><li>Multi Listener</li><li>Encrypted Channels</li></ul><h2 id="Infected-Machine"><a href="#Infected-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Infected Machine"></a>Infected Machine</h2><ul><li>Information</li><li>File Manager<ul><li>Display Image</li><li>Edit, Copy, Move, Paste, Upload, Download, Rename, Datetime</li><li>WGET</li><li>Archive: Compress, Extract</li><li>New: Folder, Text File</li></ul></li><li>Process View</li><li>Service View</li><li>Connection: Disconnect, Reconnect</li></ul><h1 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h1><p>This project was developed out of personal interest in cybersecurity research and education.<br>It must <strong>not</strong> be used for illegal or unauthorized activities.<br>The author is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this software.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='https://iss4cf0ng.github.io/images/meme/koyuki_jail.jpg'><img src="https://iss4cf0ng.github.io/images/meme/koyuki_jail.jpg" width=300></p><h1 id="Technical-Overview"><a href="#Technical-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Technical Overview"></a>Technical Overview</h1><p>Eden-RAT supprots encrypted communication using either AES/RSA hybrid encryption or TLS.</p><p>The AES pure implementation is adapted from:<br><a href="https://github.com/bozhu/AES-Python">https://github.com/bozhu/AES-Python</a></p><p>Once a payload successfully connects to the Eden server, it dynamically loads additional modules delivered by the server.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>This article demonstrates how to use the DLL and shellcode injection features of DuplexSpy.</p><p>This feature allows you to inject a DLL or shellcode into a target process. DuplexSpy also provides a DLL loader and a shellcode loader, which allows you to execute payloads without injecting them into an existing process.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about DLL and shellcode injection techniques, you can refer to the notes I wrote for studying <a href="https://iss4cf0ng.github.io/2026/01/04/2026-1-4-BookReverseEngineeringCore/#Chapter-21-Windows-Message-Hooking">reverse engineering</a> and <a href="https://iss4cf0ng.github.io/2026/01/02/2026-1-2-NoteWindowsBufferOverflow/">Windows buffer overflow</a>.</p><h1 id="Injector"><a href="#Injector" class="headerlink" title="Injector"></a>Injector</h1><p>This features allows you to inject a DLL file or shellcode in a specified process.

An x86 process canoot load an x64 DLL or shellcode, and vice versa.</p><p>DuplexSpy provides the following injection methods for both DLL and shellcode:</p><ul><li><strong>APC</strong></li><li><strong>Early Bird</strong></li><li><strong>CreateRemoteThread (default)</strong></li><li><strong>NtCreateThreadEx</strong></li><li><strong>ZwCreateThreadEx</strong></li></ul><p>Before performing an injection, you should determine the architecture of the target process. An x86 DLL cannot be injected into an x64 process, and vice versa. On x64 systems, PE files uder <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> are typically x64 binaries, while PE files under <code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64</code> are x86 binaries.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/injector/1.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/injector/1.png" width="400"></p><h1 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h1><h2 id="DLL-Injection"><a href="#DLL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="DLL Injection"></a>DLL Injection</h2><p>Notice that this method <strong>IS NOT</strong> fileless.

It acts as a socket listener on the server side. DuplexSpy provides three types of listeners, all of which offer secure and robust communication protocols.</p><h3 id="TCP"><a href="#TCP" class="headerlink" title="TCP"></a>TCP</h3><p>The data stream transmitted through this protocol is encrypted after a key exchange procedure. The server generates an RSA key pair and sends the public key to the client. The client then uses this public key to encrypt an AES key and an initialization vector (IV), and sends them back to the server.</p><p>After receiving the encrypted AES key and IV, the server decrypts them and stores them in memory. During the validation phase, the server sends a plaintext challenge to the client. The client responds with an encrypted version of the challenge using the AES algorithm. If the server can successfully decrypt the response using the stored AES key and IV, the validation procedure is considered complete. The server then notifies the client to enter the compromised state.</p><p>This protocol uses RSA-2048 and AES-256-CBC.</p><h3 id="TLS"><a href="#TLS" class="headerlink" title="TLS"></a>TLS</h3><p>This protocol provides a secure and robust communication channel for C2 traffic. Before using this listener, you must generate an SSL certificate file.</p><h3 id="HTTP"><a href="#HTTP" class="headerlink" title="HTTP"></a>HTTP</h3><p>All data are encapsulated within HTTP requests and responses. This listener also provides an encrypted communication channel to protect C2 traffic. Its handshaking procedure is identical to that of the TCP listener described above.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/http.1.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/http.1.png" width="1000"></p><h2 id="Add-a-New-Listener"><a href="#Add-a-New-Listener" class="headerlink" title="Add a New Listener"></a>Add a New Listener</h2><p>In this example, I am going to demonstrate how to add a new listener.</p><p>Firstly, click the <strong>New</strong> button on the top.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/1.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/1.png" width="700"></p><p>Now you have opened a new panel.</p><p>Select a protocol used for listener (In this case, I use <strong>TLS</strong>):</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/2.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/2.png" width="400"></p><p>Notice that you should create a certificate file if you are going to use a TLS listener. </p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/3.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/3.png" width="400">    <figcaption>    Save configuration without SSL certificate file.    </figcaption></p><p>You can create a certificate file through <code>openssl</code> command or using DuplexSpy. </p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/5.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/5.png" width="400"></p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/6.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/6.png" width="400"></p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/7.png'><img src="/images/article/tools/duplexspy/listener/7.png" width="700"></p><p>DuplexSpy checks the listener configuration before it shows.

OLE was originally implemented using an old Windows messaging mechanism called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).</p><p>COM is baed on two foundational principles. First, client communicate with objects (sometimes called COM server object) through interfaces——well-defined contracts with a set of logically related methods grouped under the virtual table dispatch mechanism, wich is also a common way for C++ compilers to implement virtual functions dispatch.<br>The second principle is that component implementation is loaded dynamically rather than being statically linked to the client.</p><p>The term COM server typically refers to a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) or an executable (EXE) where the COM classes are implemented.</p><h3 id="The-Windows-Runtime"><a href="#The-Windows-Runtime" class="headerlink" title="The Windows Runtime"></a>The Windows Runtime</h3><p>Windows 8 introduced a new API and supporting runtime called Windows Runtime (sometimes abbreviated WinRT, not to be confused with Windows RT, the discontinued ARM-based Windows OS version).</p><p>From an API perspective, WInRT is built on top of COM, adding various extensions to the base COM infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The .NET Framework</strong><br>The .NET Framework is part of Windows.</p><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th>Windows Version</th><th>.NET Framework Version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Windows 8</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 8.1</td><td>4.5.1</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10</td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 version 1511</td><td>4.6.1</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 version 1607</td><td>4.6.2</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The .NET Framework consists of two major components:</p><ul><li><strong>The Common Language Runtime (CLT)</strong></li><li><strong>The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL)</strong></li></ul><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/books/WindowsInternal1/1.1.png'><img src="/images/books/WindowsInternal1/1.1.png" width="600"></p><h3 id="Services-functions-and-routines"><a href="#Services-functions-and-routines" class="headerlink" title="Services, functions, and routines"></a>Services, functions, and routines</h3><ul><li><strong>Windows API functions</strong></li><li><strong>Native system service (or system calls)</strong></li><li><strong>Kernel support functions (or routines)</strong></li></ul><h3 id="Processes"><a href="#Processes" class="headerlink" title="Processes"></a>Processes</h3><p>Although programs and process appear similar on the surface, they are fundamentally different.</p><p>A <em>program</em> is a static sequence of instructions, whereas a <em>process</em> is a container for a set of resources used when executing the instance of the program.</p><ul><li><strong>A private virtual address space</strong></li><li><strong>An executable program</strong></li><li><strong>A list of open handles</strong></li><li><strong>A security context</strong></li><li><strong>A process ID</strong></li><li><strong>At least one thread of execution</strong></li></ul><h3 id="Threads"><a href="#Threads" class="headerlink" title="Threads"></a>Threads</h3><p>A <em>thread</em> is an entity within a process that Windows schedules for execution. Without it, the process’s program can’t run. A thread includes the follow essential components:</p><ul><li>The contents of a set of CPU registers representing the state of the processor</li><li>Two stacks——one for the thread to use while executing in kernel mode and one for executing in user mode.</li><li>A private storage area called <em>thread-lcoal storage (TLS)*</em> for use by subsystems, run-time libraries, and DLLs.</li><li>A unique identifier called a <em>thread ID</em> (part of an internal structure called a <em>client ID</em>; process IDs and thread IDs are generated out of the same namespace, so they never overlap)</li></ul><p>The threads of a 32-bit application running on a 64-bit version of WIndows will contain both 32-bit and 64-bit context, which Wow64 will use to switch the applicaion from running in 32-bit to 64-bit mode when required. These threads will have two user stacks and two <strong>CONTEXT</strong> blocks, and the usual Windows API functions will return the 64-bit context instead. The <code>Wow64GetThreadContext</code> function, however, will return the 32-bit context.</p><h4 id="Fibers"><a href="#Fibers" class="headerlink" title="Fibers"></a>Fibers</h4><p>Fibers allow an application to schedule its own threads of execution rather than rely on the priority-based scheduling mechanism built into Windows. Fibers are often called <em>lightweight threads</em>. In terms of scheduling, they are invisible to the kernel because they are implementeed in user mode in <code>kernel32.dll</code>. To use fibers, you first make a call to the Windows <code>ConvertThreadToFiber</code> function. This function converts the thread to a running fiber. Afterward, the newly converted fiber can create additonal fibers via the <code>CreateFiber</code> function (Each fiber can have its own set of fibers).</p><h4 id="User-mode-scheduling-threads"><a href="#User-mode-scheduling-threads" class="headerlink" title="User-mode scheduling threads"></a>User-mode scheduling threads</h4><p>User-mode schedulnig (UMS) threads, which are available only on 64-bit versions of Windows, provide the same basic advantages as fibers——and only a few of the disadvantages. UMS threads have their own kernel thread stat and are therefore visible to the kernel, which allows multiple UMS threads to issue blocking system calls and share and contend on resources.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/books/WindowsInternal1/1.2.png'><img src="/images/books/WindowsInternal1/1.2.png" width="600"></p><h3 id="Jobs"><a href="#Jobs" class="headerlink" title="Jobs"></a>Jobs</h3><p>Windows provides an extension to the process model called a <em>job</em>.

User application code runs in user mode, whereas OS code (such as system services and device drivers) runs in kernel mode.</p><p>Kernel mode refers to a mode of execution in a processor that grants access to all system memory and all CPU instructions.</p><p>Although each Windows process has its own private memory space, the kernel-mode OS and device-driver code share a single virtual address space. Each page in virtual memory is tagged to indicate what access mode the processor must be in to read and/or write the page.</p><p>Pages in system space can be accessed only from kernel mode, whereas all pages in the user address space are accessible from user mode and kernel mode.</p><p>Windows 10 drivers must be signed by only two of the accepted certification authorities with a SHA-2 Extended Validation (EV) Hwardware certificate instead of the regular file-based SHA-1 certiicate and its 20 authorities.</p><h3 id="Hypervisor"><a href="#Hypervisor" class="headerlink" title="Hypervisor"></a>Hypervisor</h3><p>The need for fast, efficient, and secure virtualization has driven new models of computing and reasoning about software.</p><p>To provide such virtualization services, almost all modern solutions employ the use of a <strong>hypervisor</strong>, which is a specialized and highly privileged component that allows for the virtualization and isolation of all resources on the machine, from virtual to physical memory, to device interrupts, and even to PCI and USB devices.</p><p>In Windows 10, Microsoft now leverages the Hyper-V hypervisor to provide a new set of services known as <strong>virtualization-based security (VBS)</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Device Guard</strong>: This provides Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI) for stronger code-signing guaratees over KMCS alone, and allows for the custumization of the signature policy of the Windows OS, for both user-mode and kernel mode code.</li><li><strong>Hyper Guard</strong>: This protects key kernel-related and hypervisor-related data structures and code.</li><li><strong>Credential Guard</strong>: This prevents unauthorized access to domain account credentials and secrets, combined with secure biometrics.</li><li><strong>Application Guard</strong>: This provides an even stronger sandbox for the Microsoft Edge browser.</li><li><strong>Host Guardian and Shielded Fabric</strong>: These leverage a virtual TPM (v-TPM) to protect a virtual machine from the infrastructure it’s running on.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the Hyper-V hypervisor enables certain key kernel mitigations against exploits and other attackers.</p><h3 id="Firmware"><a href="#Firmware" class="headerlink" title="Firmware"></a>Firmware</h3><h3 id="Terminal-Services-and-multiple-sessions"><a href="#Terminal-Services-and-multiple-sessions" class="headerlink" title="Terminal Services and multiple sessions"></a>Terminal Services and multiple sessions</h3><p><strong>Terminal Services</strong> refers to the support in Windows for multiple interactive user sessions on a single systerm.</p><p>With Windows Terminal Services, a remote user can establish a session on another machine, log in, and run applications on the server.</p><p>The first session is considered the services session, or session zero, and contains system service hosing processes.</p><h3 id="Objects-and-handles"><a href="#Objects-and-handles" class="headerlink" title="Objects and handles"></a>Objects and handles</h3><p>In the Windows OS, a <strong>kernel object</strong> is a single, run-time instance of a statically defined object type. An <strong>object type</strong> comprises a system-defined data type, functions that operate on instances of the data type, and a set of object attributes.</p><p>The most fundamental difference between an object and an ordinary data structure is that the internal structure of an object is opaque. You must call an object service to get data out of or put data into an object. You can’t directly read or change data in side an object.</p><p>Objects, through the help of a kernel component called the <strong>object manager</strong>.</p><p>Not all data structures in the Windows OS are objects. Only data that needs to be shared, protected, named, or made visible to user-mode programs (via system services) is placed in objects. Structures used by only one component of the OS to implement internal functions are not objects.</p><h3 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h3><p>Windows has three forms of access control over objects:</p><ul><li><strong>Discretionary access control</strong>: It’s the method by which owners of objects (such as files or printers) grant or deny access to others. With Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, this form of discretionary control is further improved by implementing attribute-based access control (also called Dynamic Access Control).</li><li><strong>Privileged access control</strong>: This is necessary for those times when discretionary access control is not enough. It’s a method of ensuring that someone can get to protected objects if the owner isn’t available.</li><li><strong>Mandatory integrity control</strong>: This is required when an additional level of security control is needed to protect objects that are being accessed from within the same user account.</li></ul><p>Starting with Windows 8, a sandbox called an <strong>AppContainer</strong> is used to host Windows Apps, which provides isolation with relation to other AppContainers and non-Windows Apps processes.</p><h3 id="Registry"><a href="#Registry" class="headerlink" title="Registry"></a>Registry</h3><h3 id="Unicode"><a href="#Unicode" class="headerlink" title="Unicode"></a>Unicode</h3><h1 id="Chapter-2-System-architecture"><a href="#Chapter-2-System-architecture" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2 - System architecture"></a>Chapter 2 - System architecture</h1><h2 id="Operating-system-model"><a href="#Operating-system-model" class="headerlink" title="Operating system model"></a>Operating system model</h2><h2 id="Architecture-overview"><a href="#Architecture-overview" class="headerlink" title="Architecture overview"></a>Architecture overview</h2><p>Despite its pervasive use of objects to represent shared system resources, Windows is not an object-oriented system in the strict sense. Most of the kernel-mdoe OS code is written in C for portability. The C programming language doesn’t directly support object-oriented constructs such as polymorphic functions or class inheritance. Therefore, the C-based implementation of objects in Windows borrows from, but doesn’t depend on, features of particular object-oriented languages.</p><p align="center" class='item-img' data-src='/images/books/WindowsInternal1/2.1.png'><img src="/images/books/WindowsInternal1/2.1.png" width="600"></p><p>The boexes above the line represent user-mode processes, and the components below the line are kernel-mode OS services.</p><p>A second dividing line between kernel-mode parts of Windwos and the hypervisor is also visible. The hypervisor still runs with the same CPU privilege level (0) as the kernel, but because it uses specialized CPU instructions (VT-x on Intel, SVM on AMD), it can both isolate itself from the kernel while also monitoring it (and applications). Some people may call it <strong>ring -1</strong>, which is <strong>INACCURATE</strong>.</p><p>Four basic types of user-mode processes:</p><ul><li><strong>User processes</strong></li><li><strong>Service processes</strong></li><li><strong>System processes</strong></li><li><strong>Environment sybsystem server processes</strong></li></ul><p>Windows 10 Version 1607 includes a Windows Sybsystem for Linux (WSL) in beta state for developers only. However, this is not a true subsystem as described in this section.</p><p>Notice the Sybsystem DLLs blox below the Service Processes and User Processes boxes. Under Windows, user applications don’t call the native Windows OS services directly. Rather, they go through on or more <strong>subsystem dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)</strong>. The role of subsystem DLLs is to translate a documented function into the appropriate internal (and generally undocumented) native system service calls implemented mostly in <strong>Ntdll.dll</strong>.</p><p>The kernel-mode components of Windows include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Executive</strong>: The Windows executive contains the base OS services, such as memory management, process and thread management, security, I/O, networking, and inter-process communication.</li><li><strong>The Windows kernel</strong></li><li><strong>Device drivers</strong>: This includes both hardware device drivers, and non-hardware device drivers.</li><li><strong>The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</strong></li><li><strong>The windowing and graphics system</strong></li><li><strong>The hypervisor layer</strong>: This is composed of the hypervisor itself.

You can create deadlock with two threads and no locks by having each thread call <code>join()</code> on the <code>std::thread</code> object for the other. In this case, neither thread can make progress because it’s waiting for the other to finish.</p><p>The guidlines for avoiding deadlock all boil down to one idea: don’t wait for another thread if there’s a chance it’s waiting for you.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid nested locks</strong>:<br>Don’t acquire a lock if you already hold one. If you stick to this guidline, it’s impossible to get a deadlock from the lock usage alone because each thread only ever holds a single lock. You should still get deadlock from other things (like the threads waiting for each other), but mutex locks are probably the most common cause of deadlock.</li><li><strong>Avoid calling user-suplied code while holding a lock</strong>:<br>This is a simple follow-on from the previous guidline. Because the code is user-supplied, you have no idea what it could do; it could do anything, including acquiring a lock.</li><li><strong>Acquire locks in a fixed order</strong>:<br>If you absolutely must acquire two or more locks, and you can’t acquire them as a single operation with <code>std::lock</code>, the next best thing is to acquire them in the same order in every thread.</li><li><strong>Use a lock hiearchy</strong>:<br>Although this is a particular case of defining lock ordering, a lock hierarchy can provide a means of checking that the convention is adhered to at runtime. The idea is that you divide your application into layers and identify all the mutexes that may be locked in any given layer.</li><li><strong>Extending these guidlines beyond locks</strong>:<br>Deadlocks also occur with any synchronization construct that can lead to a wait cycle.\<br>If you’re going to wait for a thread to finish, it might be worth identifying a thread hierarchy, so that a thread waits only for threads lower down the hierarchy.

All operations on such types are atomic, and only operations on these types are atomic in the sense of the language definition, although you can use mutexes to make other operation <strong>appear</strong> atomic.</p><p>This is important to know in many cases——the key use case for atomic operations is as a replacement for an operation that would otherwise use a mutex for synchronization.</p><p>The library provides a set of macros to identify at compile time whether the atomic types for the various integral types are lock-free.</p><p>Since C++17, all atomic types have a <code>static constexpr</code> member variable, <code>X::is_always_lock_free</code>, which is <code>true</code> if and only if the atomic type <code>X</code> is lock-free for all supported hardware that the output of the current compilation might run on.</p><h1 id="Chapter-6-Designing-lock-based-concurrent-data-structures"><a href="#Chapter-6-Designing-lock-based-concurrent-data-structures" class="headerlink" title="Chapter.6 - Designing lock-based concurrent data structures"></a>Chapter.6 - Designing lock-based concurrent data structures</h1><h1 id="Chapter-7-Designing-lock-free-concurrent-data-structures"><a href="#Chapter-7-Designing-lock-free-concurrent-data-structures" class="headerlink" title="Chapter.7 - Designing lock-free concurrent data structures."></a>Chapter.7 - Designing lock-free concurrent data structures.</h1><h1 id="Chapter-8-Designing-concurrent-code"><a href="#Chapter-8-Designing-concurrent-code" class="headerlink" title="Chapter.8 - Designing concurrent code"></a>Chapter.8 - Designing concurrent code</h1><h1 id="Chapter-10-Advanced-thread-management"><a href="#Chapter-10-Advanced-thread-management" class="headerlink" title="Chapter.10 - Advanced thread management"></a>Chapter.10 - Advanced thread management</h1>]]></content>
